		    <h1>Clan Wars</h1>
		    <h2>Prep Day</h2>
		    <p>The 24 hour prep day is important to winning the war. Every member needs to make sure that their war base has all of the defenses setup and the base protected inside of their walls. Prior to the war beginning everyone should pick out who they want to attack and announce it to the clan. Try to choose someone close to your rank that you are able to three star.</p>
<h2>Troop Donations</h2>
<p>The donation of troops will be handled by top level players. This will give the clan the best chance for victory.</p>

<div class="troop-desc">
<h4>Wizards</h4>
Wizards have the highest DPS(damage per second)/space in the game. Their ranged attack and splash damage make them a valuable troop. The primary weakness is the dragon and being picked off by spread out Archers. Level 6 can survive a lightning while level 5 are unable to. Generally speaking you can sleep easy knowing you have wizards to defend your base.</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<img src="img/witch.png" class="troop"/>
<div class="troop-desc">
<h4>Witches</h4>
Witches have low DPS &amp; Health, but what makes these babes so great  is they spawn up to 8 skeletons at a time, which is great, taking out  pesky ground troops or air. They work as a re-spawnable distraction, while added with another troop, archer/wizard, to mop up and take out  the distracted enemy troops.</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<img src="img/dragon.png" class="troop"/>
<div class="troop-desc">
<h4>Dragon</h4>
Dragons have high health, and splash damage as well, require a little  more troop waste to take out, but are slow, and a raid can be raided  around them.</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<img src="img/archer.png" class="troop" />
<div class="troop-desc">
<h4>Archers</h4>
With one housing space, a maximum of 35, are quick, and take a  long time to lure, but are weak and can be one hit with a lightning but also have an added advantage of a range attack.</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<img src="img/valkyrie.png" class="troop valkyrie" />
<div class="troop-desc">
<h4>Valkyries</h4>
Splash, high damage and a good health, downside, can only target  ground troops, these are great at holding of a hog attack. They are also effective for defending low level bases because they can one shot a large number of barbarians and archers.</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<img src="img/barbarian.png" class="troop" />
<div class="troop-desc">
<h4>Barbarians</h4>
Barbs! Fresh info on these cool little critters, as these are slow  meat shields, luring these warriors is the slowest process and hardest  to lure, so a little more troop wastage will be made in the process of  doing so! I would assume, this is great for hog attacks. But only target ground troops!</div>
<div class="clear"></div>

<p>Select which troops you want wisely based on your base design. Please do not use clan wars as a testing ground for your defensive tactics. If you have questions feel free to ask the clan.</p>
<h2>Base Design</h2>
<p>If you have anything upgrading your clan war base will automatically revert back to its previous level, and a new building, ie, a new Wizard Tower will be fully working for your war defense!</p>
<p>Always remember to place your town hall in the middle of your base! It is the difference between a 1 star and a 2 star loss, players are more likely to attack as they are guaranteed a win. Use a transformer base if you're a heavy farmer to make it easy to move your town hall inside for the war base. Note that your shield and loot are NOT affected by clan wars. If you want to place all of your storage outside to help fortify the middle you won't lose any resources. They have high hit points and can be a better shield than most other buildings.</p>
<h2> Day 2: The Battle</h2>
<p>Pick your troops and your strategy based on the base you are attacking and the strategies you are most familiar with. Before you begin the attack make certain you have full spells, a full army, and a full clan castle. It is better to pick off your opponent's clan castle troops before you engage their defensive structures. </p>
<p>Good luck to all and have fun!</p>
