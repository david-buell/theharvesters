		    <h1>Clan Wars</h1>
			<h2>War Search</h2>
			<p>The war search process determines the clan we are matched up with. The longer the search takes the more likely the matchup will be unbalanced. We want balanced matchups because we use more of our attacks and earn a higher attack to star ratio than most of our opponents. If we are matched up with too tough of an opponent we may be unable to earn enough stars. To prevent this from happening we will cancel the search after 15 minutes and restart it to prevent the search scope from becoming too wide.</p>
			<p>If you are interested in reading more about the matchmaking process you can read up on it on <a href="http://forum.supercell.net/showthread.php/381173-War-matchmaking-explained" target="_blank">SuperCell's forum</a>.</p>

						<h2>Troop Donations</h2>
						<p>The donation of troops will be handled by top level players first. To maximize the benefit of high level troops, the bottom 7 bases will be given 1 Valkyrie each and the bottom 3 bases with 20 troop space will each be given a dragon. The rest of the bases are not as affected by the clan castle troops they are given. Use the following as a guide to determine good troops to hand out.</p>

						<img src="img/dragon.png" class="troop"/>
						<div class="troop-desc">
						<h4>Dragons</h4>
						<div class="rating">Rating: 9/10</div>
						If your clan castle is close to the center of your base and you have space for one it is hard to go wrong with a dragon. These fire breathing lizards from hell are great for defense. They have high health and splash damage. A little more troop waste is required to take them out. There only downside is that a raid can work around them due to their slow movement speed.</div>
						<div class="clear"></div>

						<img src="img/wizard.png" class="troop"/>
						<div class="troop-desc">
						<h4>Wizards</h4>
						<div class="rating">Rating: 8/10</div>
						Wizards have the highest DPS(damage per second)/space in the game. Their ranged attack and splash damage make them a valuable troop. The primary weakness is the dragon and being picked off by spread out Archers. Level 6 can survive a lightning while level 5 are unable to. Generally speaking you can sleep easy knowing you have wizards to defend your base.</div>
						<div class="clear"></div>

						<img src="img/archer.png" class="troop" />
						<div class="troop-desc">
						<h4>Archers</h4>
						<div class="rating">Rating: 6/10</div>
						Archers are hands-down the best cheap unit to use in the Clan Castle. There are three primary advantages of using Archers: high damage, range, and ability to shoot air units. While the Archer's damage is typically not considered high due to its propensity to get easily killed, it is not so easy to take out Archers on defense.</div>
						<div class="clear"></div>

						<img src="img/valkyrie.png" class="troop valkyrie" />
						<div class="troop-desc">
						<h4>Valkyries</h4>
						<div class="rating">Rating: 6/10</div>
						The one area where Valkyries are particularly effective is in the Clan Castle. The Valkyrie is strong against Archers and Barbarians. Their splash damage and high DPS make them extremely effective in defending low level bases since they can one shot large groups of units.</div>
						<div class="clear"></div>

						<img src="img/minion.jpg" class="troop minion"/>
						<div class="troop-desc">
						<h4>Minions</h4>
						<div class="rating">Rating: 5/10</div>
						A flying Archer that throws dark elixer at its enemies. These little blue guys take up 2 housing spaces each and cannot take a hit. They are great for attacking in mass but in smaller numbers like the Clan Castle for defense they are less effective.</div>
						<div class="clear"></div>

						<img src="img/witch.png" class="troop"/>
						<div class="troop-desc">
						<h4>Witches</h4>
						<div class="rating">Rating: 5/10</div>
						Witches have low DPS &amp; Health, but what makes these babes so great  is they spawn up to 8 skeletons at a time, which is great, taking out  pesky ground troops or air. They work as a re-spawnable distraction, while added with another troop, archer/wizard, to mop up and take out  the distracted enemy troops.</div>
						<div class="clear"></div>

						<img src="img/balloon.png" class="troop balloon" />
						<div class="troop-desc">
						<h4>Balloons</h4>
						<div class="rating">Rating: 4/10</div>
						If you consider Balloons a poor man's dragon then you may understand how useful they are. They have good attack power and are slow enough not to be lured out. They are weak against the ranged attack of an archer and are obviously terrible against air units. They do have their merit however. Lower level guys unable to hold a dragon may find these floating wall breakers a useful choice.</div>
						<div class="clear"></div>

						<img src="img/barbarian.png" class="troop" />
						<div class="troop-desc">
						<h4>Barbarians</h4>
						<div class="rating">Rating: 4/10</div>
						Barbs! Fresh info on these cool little critters, as these are slow  meat shields, luring these warriors is the slowest process and hardest  to lure, so a little more troop wastage will be made in the process of  doing so! I would assume, this is great for hog attacks. But only target ground troops!</div>
						<div class="clear"></div>
						<p>Select which troops you want wisely based on your base design. Please do not use clan wars as a testing ground for your defensive tactics. If you have questions feel free to ask the clan.</p>

							<h2>Base Design</h2>
							<p>If you have anything upgrading your clan war base will automatically revert back to its previous level, and a new building, ie, a new Wizard Tower will be fully working for your war defense!</p>
							<p>Always remember to place your town hall in the middle of your base! It is the difference between a 1 star and a 2 star loss, players are more likely to attack as they are guaranteed a win. Use a transformer base if you're a heavy farmer to make it easy to move your town hall inside for the war base. Note that your shield and loot are NOT affected by clan wars. If you want to place all of your storage outside to help fortify the middle you won't lose any resources. They have high hit points and can be a better shield than most other buildings.</p>

						<h2>Prep Day</h2>
						<p>The 24 hour prep day is important to winning the war. Every member needs to make sure that their war base has all of the defenses setup and the base protected inside of their walls. Prior to the war beginning everyone should pick out who they want to attack and announce it to the clan. Try to choose someone close to your rank that you are able to three star.</p>
							<h2> Day 2: The Battle</h2>
							<p>Pick your troops and your strategy based on the base you are attacking and the strategies you are most familiar with. Before you begin the attack make certain you have full spells, a full army, and a full clan castle. It is better to pick off your opponent's clan castle troops before you engage their defensive structures. </p>
							<p>Good luck to all and have fun!</p>
